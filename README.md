# SUMMARY
API REPO FOR BOOKSHOP RENTAL APP


## Notes for developer
### Writing Code
The code is organized by environment, as detailed below. Refer heavily to the Terraform docs for the specifics of each data source, resource, providers, and more.

Ensure you have activated the pre-commit hooks by [installing pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/#install "pre-commit install")
```bash
pre-commit install
```
from the root of the repo. Now, every commit will be tested for a few easily-fixable errors and formatting.
